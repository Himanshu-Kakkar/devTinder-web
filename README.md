## What This Frontend Can Do (Theoretical Overview)

The **devConnect frontend** acts as the visual layer of the platform, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the backend services. It provides:

- **Payment Interface** — integrated with Razorpay for secure payments.  
- **Responsive Design** — adapts smoothly to tablet, and desktop screens.

## Key Technologies & Tools Learned

During the development of this frontend, I explored and implemented several modern web technologies:

- **React.js** — for building a modular and fast single-page application (SPA).  
- **Tailwind CSS** — for sleek, responsive, and efficient styling.  
- **Axios** — for making API requests to the backend.  
- **React Router DOM** — for page navigation and route management.  
- **Socket.IO Client** — for enabling real-time chat functionality.  
- **Razorpay** — for handling payment flows on the client side.
